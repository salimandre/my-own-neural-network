    A building block. Each layer is capable of performing two things:
    
    - Process input to get output:           output = layer.forward(input)
    
    - Propagate gradients through itself:    grad_input = layer.backward(input, grad_output)

        Luckily, you already receive d loss / d layer as input, so you only need to multiply it by d layer / d x.
        
        If your layer has parameters (e.g. dense layer), you also need to update them here using d loss / d layer
